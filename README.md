# Document Policy

Document Policy is a web platform API which gives a website the ability to allow and deny the use of browser features in its own frame, and in iframes that it embeds.

The spec is currently hosted on the Permissions Policy repo, at https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html, although it will move here soon.

For more explanation, use cases, examples, etc., please refer to [the document policy explainer document](https://github.com/wicg/document-policy/blob/master/document-policy-explainer.md).
